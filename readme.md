# Project stocks

Project stocks is a whacky and simple trading game. In it, you can buy and sell stocks, invest in portfolio's and predict market fluctuactions. Do you have what it takes to become a millionaire? How about a zintillionaire? 

# Details

## For players

Project stocks is a highly configurable, lean and fast machine. Want to introduce new companies, products or eavesdrops? Well, as long as you know a bit of JSON (it's easy if you don't!) you can!

On the backend, Project stocks implements an unrealistic, but reasonable, stock simulation algorithm.

## For developers

### License

We believe games are often cherished by players long after the developer has moved onto bigger and better software.

We therefore have made Project stocks licensed under the permissive MIT license. Anyone is capable of keeping this software going with new features, bugfixes and support for platforms that may exist in the future.

Our music and artwork may not be distributed or adapted, either commercial or otherwise.
